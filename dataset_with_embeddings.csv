"Armenian Branch of Mendez England and Associates
TITLE:  Water Resources Specialist
TERM:  Up to 30 days over 5 months period
LOCATION:  Yerevan, Armenia
JOB DESCRIPTION:  Drastic increase of water demand in the Republic of
Armenia during the last 40-50 years has affected hydrological regime of
river flow, as well as quantity and status of water resources. Quantity
of rivers, lakes and groundwater aquifers, which are consumed
significantly and polluted heavily due to remainders from drinking/
domestic, industrial and agricultural activities, is constantly
increasing in the Republic of Armenia. Currently there is practically no
river basin in Armenia with the natural hydrological regime. This regime
has been disturbed in a way or other, due to human economic activity.
The last reliable and complete works on characteristics of water
resources in Armenia were conducted for Aras and Kura river basins, using
the historical data covering the period up to 1965. Considering the
requirements set under the RA National Water Program, as well as new
hydrological and hydro-economic data accumulated in Armenian water
related organizations during 1965-2011, and quantitative and qualitative
changes occurred within that period, due to impact of anthropogenic
factors and global climate change, presently there is a necessity to
develop a new, reliable, modern and for the first time Armenian bulletin
on surface waters of the Republic of Armenia.            
As part of this Terms of Reference, activities will be implemented to
develop relevant characteristics for Vorotan river basin.
JOB RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Verify characteristics of river basin water resources, through
expanding data series for acting hydrological observation points;
- Based on verified data, restor data series for hydrological
observations points which are not presently operational;
- Calculate relevant characteristics for the river basin sections which
have not been studied (which have no hydrological observation points). 
The above mentioned tasks should cover the following hydrological
characteristics:
- Natural river flow;
- Ecological flow;
- Water use (for irrigation, drinking/domestic, industrial, hydropower,
fishery purposes), return waters after use;
- Hydro-economic balance of the river basin and its sections.
REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:
- Over 10 years of experience in similar assignments;
- Applicants cannot be government employees or civil servants.
APPLICATION PROCEDURES:  Please send a resume in English to the attention
of Mikayel Koshkaryan at: mkoshkaryan@... . Please clearly mention
""Water Resources Specialist"" in the subject line. Only shortlisted
candidates will be contacted. No phone calls, please.
